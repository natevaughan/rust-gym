Fun little tasks to learn rust.

## Questions

Questions I'm exploring for further reading and exploration:
 - Why does the borrow checker check for borrows of immutable data?
 - What are the apostrophes for `&str` in structs e.g. `&'static str`?
 - Where are different kinds of strings stored `String`, `&str`, `&'static str`? Heap, stack, ...?
 - Why do some impls reference `&self`` and others `self`?
